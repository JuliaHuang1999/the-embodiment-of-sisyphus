He solely trekked to Taipei at the young age of 15 and had to work his way through school. His “first pot of gold” was quickly amassed in two years with his hard work. Then, he started his own business and even spreaded investment in mainland China a couple years ago.

                                    <br>After an emergency surgery, he regained consciousness only to discover the dawning and heartbreaking fact: he’d lost control of his lower body. Plunged into a state of despair, he could hardly check the impulse and swallowed 60 sleeping pills to end his life. Luckily, someone found him in time and Mr. Chiu was given a second chance to live.<br>
                                    <br>“When I woke up, the first sentence I uttered was <strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">‘Why am I still alive? Why did I have to be saved?’</strong>A social worker comforted me with a bunch of cliche saying but I told him: ‘About the thing you said, I got it. But you’ll never relate to the feeling of waking up the next day to find out you are completely paralyzed and could never walk again’, ” said Mr. Chiu. 
<br>
                                    <br>“I wanted to buy some stuff from the convenience store. A big-hearted girl tried to help me with my wheelchair but I didn’t know my right foot had been scraped the entire way,” described Mr. Chiu with a wry smile, recalling the day he recently got discharged from the hospital. “Only when I saw a puddle of blood on the floor, which had the clerk freaked out, did I realize my toe had been scratched so deep that even the bone was visible,” continued Mr. Chiu.

                                    <br>In the early days, Mr. Chiu depended heavily on other’s help for basically everything so he ended up in a costly nursing home for two years. The astronomical expenses soon depleted all his savings. He was then transferred to a nursing home that he was referred to by the Social Welfare Bureau in Sanchong District for the next three years. <br>
                                    <br>Although he was spared the expensive charge for the nursing home due to his referral by the Social Welfare Bureau, Mr. Chiu was unqualified for the subsidies for the low-income and disabled residents. He could only receive 5000 NTD of severe disability subsidy thanks to his recent operation. Yet, he was downgraded to “moderate” on his disability status after a year and therefore, he could no longer be subsidized.<br>
                                    <br>At the end of last year, Mr. Chiu discovered a place that helped match the disabled with suitable job opportunities on the Internet. Later, he was referred to a shelter factory for the physically and mentally challenged people. Not only was the shelter a house mainly for the mentally challenged, it was also a 
“disabled-unfriendly” environment where no barrier-free facilities were built. <strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">“It was impossible for wheelchair users like me to reach the main entrance because of the front door steps.”</strong>

                                    <br>He once went to a foundation that guided independent work for the disabilities in Taoyuan. Sadly, Mr. Chiu had no other option but to turn down the chance of working there because he had to take the bus from Taipei to Taoyuan every day, costing him at least 700 NTD a day. Back then, Mr. Chiu could barely afford his phone bill, let alone the additional commute expenditure. 
<br>
                                    <br>Soon, Mr. Chiu came across the Hsinchulun Association, a foundation that assists people with disabilities to become self-sufficient by street peddling and also offers him accommodations he was in critical need. Seeing Mr. Chiu’s hand festooned with thick callus from propelling his wheelchair, the Association gifted him an electric wheelchair, rendering his movement more at ease.

                                    <br>“At first, I was barely getting by because street peddling was too different from my pre-wheelchair-bound life,” acknowledged Mr. Chiu.  <br>
                                    <br>To peddle goods and face strangers on the street alone, Mr. Chiu had to readjust his mindset and attitude. “I was nothing but a physically challenged person. I’ve changed, specifically my mentality, a lot throughout the years. If I didn’t change how I view the world, I could never start peddling,” Mr. Chiu revealed.  
<br>
                                    <br>However, people often cast surly glances at him. “At times, I would wonder where did these discriminatory looks come from. In the past, some perfectly healthy people would scam the public by faking their disabilities. Maybe they’ve fallen into those traps before so they lump me together with them.  <strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">In fact, they have no idea about those who are truly challenged</strong>,”sighed Mr. Chiu.

                                    <br>“Tons of people would not buy stuff from me until they were sure that my legs were legit paralyzed,” disclosed Mr. Chiu. Pointing at the placard hanging in front of his wheelchair he continued to say, “That’s why I wrote this. I want to clear the air.”
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Going on streets to peddle is a means of being independent but getting other’s pity looks and compassion is the inseparable byproduct. “For what it’s worth, I want to put food on the table on my own. I don’t need people’s sympathy,” asserted Mr. Chiu. He also mentioned that he happened upon his old friend while peddling but was treated with an empathetic look and attitude. “That felt downright uncomfortable. I don’t need that. I can make bucks by peddling and carry on with my life. Before I pull my life back together, I will not seek help from anyone. <strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">Perhaps I haven’t fully gotten over this whole thing</strong>,” Mr. Chiu expressed.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Mr. Chiu works around 8 hours a day on the streets with a 1-hour break in between. For a disabled person, long hours of work can be physically laborious. He described: “Peddling for 8 hours straight really whacks me out, especially with my spine injury and poor blood circulation in the lower half of my body. Thankfully, my arms are strong enough to prop my body up during break time to improve blood circulation.”

                                    <br>When asked about how to soup up the current regulations, policies and welfare system, Mr. Chiu deemed that issues can be divided into two categories based on different targets.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>“First of all, lots of physically challenged people have severe conditions who can’t live on their own or are even unconscious. I think the government hasn’t been doing good enough to take care of this group of people since looking after them can be a heavy burden for their family members, mentally, physically and financially speaking.  <br><strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">If the government hands out an extra amount of subsidy, these families will see it as a hope to grasp on and keep going on</strong>,”suggested Mr. Chiu.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>“Secondly, for those clear-headed disabled like me, barrier-free facilities are what matters the most. <strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">Public areas should provide more barrier-free facilities.</strong> Just take me as an example. The shelter factory I was willing to work for had no facilities, leaving me no choice but to bail out,” Mr. Chiu mentioned.

                                    <br>According to the Person with Disabilities Rights Protection Act, government and private agencies at all levels are required to hire a certain proportion of the disabled. 
<br><strong style=" background: rgba(239, 184, 65, 0.5)">Unfortunately, in reality, many corporations and agencies rather pay the difference subsidies to the Disabled Employment Funds than recruit challenged employees.</strong>。
                                    <br>
                                    <br>“From employers’ point of view, hiring people with disabilities does no good to the company. Businesses are essentially profit-oriented, so it makes no sense to pay the disabled workers while taking care of them at the same time,” admitted Mr. Chiu.<br><br> He couldn’t help but let out a huge sigh when speaking of the predicament of the working conditions for people with disabilities. He exhaled and uttered, “Even if the company opens up to hire us, it is impossible for spine injured patients like me who bank on wheelchairs to work for them if there’s no barrier-free facility.”

According to the data provided by the Ministry of Labor, of all categories, “physically disabled” accounts for the majority with more than 360,000 people in Taiwan; yet, only 90,000 people are in the labor force, indicating that those who can earn money on their own like Mr. Chiu only makes up around 23%.

Groups with severe and profound conditions (less than 10 percent of them have the ability to work) contribute to over 25 percent of the entire disabled community,which is  around 310,000 people.

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The labor rights of the challenged people are mainly protected by Article 4 of the Person with Disabilities Rights Protection Act. Nevertheless, as Mr. Chiu mentioned in the interview, some shelter factories do not have barrier-free facilities, which can deter the disabled from getting the job. Moreover, factors such as income and out-of-pocket transportation costs have to be taken into account as well. The current system is in need of transformation.

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Although the law explicitly demands employers to hire a certain number of people with disabilities, it turns out to be futile. For instance, according to Article 38 of the Person with Disabilities Rights Protection Act, private sectors whose total employees exceed 67 people shall hire no less than 1 percent of the total employment of people with disabilities. Yet, an avalanche of companies are reluctant to recruit them. Instead, employers rather pay the difference subsidies to make up for the gap in recruiting sufficient numbers of challenged employees, which is an easier way out. Hence, securing a stable job tends to be challenging for this minority group of people.

Therefore, how to materialize the purpose of regulations is an ardent hope for nearly 1.2 million people with disabilities nationwide.

Tackling unemployment problems, relying on others’ care and handing out stratospheric medical expenses are the daily routine of people with disabilities, which can be an intolerable burden for their families that tears them apart.
